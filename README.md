===================

Photo gallery site for my friend

![Site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pen-Guin/flickr-gallery-site/master/Pic.png)

This site is created with awesome project of [Bootstrap Image Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery "Bootstrap Image Gallery") 
The functions added is as below.
* Skipping to the bottom secion as the introduction of a photographer
* Search filterling the photos by tag
* Tag is identified id of <a> element in the search list element
...It will be the configurable template.
Anyways I would like to generate the introduction of a photographer and the search list automatically.
